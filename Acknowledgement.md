This is just my personal notes on the success (well not really) of developing a fullstack app. More of it, I learned everything and implmented everything within just a few days! Maybe 1.5 day in total. Though I believe that my current understanding of this app is not yet a whole. But yes, I do get the essence of using springboot for enterprise, the mvvm approach, and focusing on what's in front of me instead of doing useless planning for too long.

It is a pretty tiring week since I got meets, projects, work stuffs, freelance stuffs that I need to finish too beside executing this project. But yea, it seems that everything went well for me. I believe I had some minor mistakes on the code, but it was reasonable for me since I think I only got 5% of knowledge at the start of this project.

I also really want to get to know UI Kit for the iOS development since I did SwiftUI at the Apple Foundation Program last month (May 2024). But, unfortunately I don't have the device YET. We will see in the future tho, who knows maybe I will encounter those challenge.

A message for my past-self when I started the very first journey is actually just GO FOR IT! If you have very limited time on doing something maybe you can go approach the basic understanding, the big idea, and the big picture of how things work on the stack. If you have some time to digest the small part of the development tools, please do so. My approach so far was just constantly looking for codebases, reference, documentation, and of course gpt helped me a lot even tho THE CODE IS VERY OUTDATED (imo). Finding a good codebase is also the first step towards developing something that you currently don't have any idea.

I think that's it, thank you for reading this nonsense, I wish you all good luck for your future endeavours. Keep on sailin` â›µ!
